* Primary
** [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/443810/This_Is_the_Police/][This Is Police]], but more personality in "officers/investigators"
** [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/2680550/Hollywood_Animal/][Hollywood Animal]] — the same company, as This Is Police
** [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/323190/Frostpunk/][Frostpunk]], but with more attention to actors rather then resources
** [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1649950/News_Tower/][News Tower]] (release 13 February 2024)
* Secondary
** [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/262060/Darkest_Dungeon/][Darkest Dungeon]], but with automatic dungeon explorations
** X-Com series, but with no battles and base building
** [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/632470/Disco_Elysium__The_Final_Cut/][Disco Elysium]] — would be a win if we could take the "vibe" and "character progression system" from there
